            I am an undergraduate engineering student from Kolkata, West Bengal, India where I was born and raised. I always had a knack for video games, from when I was in class 6 when I got my first PC I used to pirate games(still do bcz I'm broke 😅) and play for hours and I remember how I got so immersed into the world of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood which was my first actual AAA game before that I played some pre-installed games which were not so fun.

            PC gaming was my 'aha' moment which led me to choose the path of computer science because I wanted to know how games work internally and also how to make one. I have started to learn to make games of my own. One of my dreams is to publish my own indie game on Steam.🔥
